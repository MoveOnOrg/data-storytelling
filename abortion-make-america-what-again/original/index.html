      <p>2022: <b>6 MAGA Justices</b> overtuned Roe, <b>took away the right to abortions for millions</b> of Americans and <b>turned the clock back to 1972</b>. But they aren't stopping there</p>
      <p>After Roe was overturned, <b>Michigan Republicans are trying to enforce a 1930s anti-abortion law</b> —from a time when there was no right to contraception, same-sex relations were a felony, interracial marriage was illegal, and pregnancy was a fireable offense.</p>
      <p>... MAGA Republicans are trying to enforce some of the country's oldest abortion laws — <b>from the 1800s — in West Virginia, Wisconsin and Arizona</b> and elsewhere.  These laws date back to a time when only some white men could vote and <b>enslaving people was still legal</b> across the U.S. South.</p>
      <p>MAGA Justices say they look back to the original intent of the "founders"— white men who allowed slavery and lived at a time <b>when women had to forfeit property when they married</b>. And even then, they did not ban abortions in America's founding. </p>
      <p>In overturning of Roe the MAGA Justices even quotes an English judge from the 1600s—one also <b>wrote justifying rape in marriage and sentenced two elderly women to death for witchcraft</b> in 1662.</p>
      <p><b>But we've defeated the MAGAs of previous generations before.</b></p>
      <p>From before the country's founding <b>women took care of each other</b>. Midwife-provided <b>abortion was safe, common and legal</b>.</p>
      <p>Abolitionists <b>built the underground railroad and then helped end slavery</b>.</p>
      <p>Suffragists helped secure <b>voting for white women</b>. And workers came together to secure <b>minimum wage, workers rights, and a 2-day weekend</b>.</p>
      <p>The <b>Civil Rights movement expanded more rights to Black people</b> through its fight for political and economic power. And <b>activists won LGBTQ+ rights including marriage equality</b>. </p>
      <p>Together, <b>we moved beyond the judges of the 1600s and the laws of the 1800s</b> and made progress toward freedom and equal rights. <b>And we'll do it again</b>.</p>
      <p>So the question <b>we need to ask ourself...</b><br /> is <b>whose future do we want to create?</b> Ours or theirs? And what will we do to create that future?</p>
