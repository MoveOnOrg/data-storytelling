            <p>ProPublica got access to 4 years of tax returns of some of the richest people in the U.S. </p>

                <p>Normally when people sell investments - like stocks - they pay taxes on the money they earned on that investment. But like with many things, there are ways to get around that.</p>
                <p>In the simplified scenario below our Billionaire CEO started out 2015 with $5 million invested in each of 10 different stocks. (These 10 stocks were all among the 100 largest companies at the time). </p>

                <p>[in actual version this would only show up after you selected the losing stock]</p>
                <p>The $50 Million you started with across these 10 stocks is now worth $178 Million, but by selling a losing investment along with a neutral one, you can not only free up some cash for your yacht, but you can claim investment "losses" on your taxes.</p>
                <p>In fact, this might be a good time to exercise some of those stock options -- since you can offset those earnings with your investment "losses" and avoid taxation you'd otherwise have to pay when you used your stock option. </p>
                <p>[EDITORIAL NOTE: no idea if/when/how this offsetting is allowed - needs fact-checking]</p>
